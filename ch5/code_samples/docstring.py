def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

    The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum
    of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This implementation uses
    an iterative approach for better performance with large values of n.

    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (0-indexed).

    Returns:
        int: The n-th Fibonacci number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is a negative integer.

    Examples:
        >>> fibonacci(0)
        0
        >>> fibonacci(1)
        1
        >>> fibonacci(5)
        5
